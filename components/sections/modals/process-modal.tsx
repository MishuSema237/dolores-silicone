        Our journey begins with selecting the finest quality silicone. Each
        Reborn baby starts as a blank kit, carefully chosen for its anatomical
        accuracy and potential for lifelike transformation. We prioritize the
        safety and durability of our materials, ensuring they are non-toxic and
        long-lasting.

        The next step is the meticulous painting process. Our skilled artists
        apply multiple thin layers of specialized silicone paints, gradually
        building up realistic skin tones, mottling, veins, and delicate
        blushing. This detailed technique captures the subtle nuances of a
        newborn's skin, making each baby truly unique.

        Hair micro-rooting is then performed, strand by painstaking strand,
        using high-quality mohair or human hair to create a natural hairline.
        Finally, each baby is carefully weighted with fine glass beads, giving
        it the realistic feel and balance of an actual infant. Every stitch,
        every brushstroke, every detail is a testament to our dedication to
        artistry and realism.
