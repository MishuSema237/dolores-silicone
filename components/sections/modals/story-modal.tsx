        Reborn Babies was founded on a passion for transforming silicone into
        breathing works of art. Our journey began with a single artist's dream
        to create dolls that not only look real but also evoke the same warmth
        and emotion as a real baby. Over the years, this dream has grown into a
        collective of dedicated artisans, each bringing their unique talent to
        craft these precious creations.
